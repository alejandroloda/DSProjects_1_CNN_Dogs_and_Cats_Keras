# CNN Dogs and Cats classifier _Using Keras_

First Data Science Project of my list.

Create a classifier for Kaggle competition [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition). Taking notes in the process and trying to learn every step of the flow.

Try different approaches and create multimedia resources in the process.

## Miscellaneous

_visual_keras_ library from https://github.com/ellolo/visual-keras

(It's necessary modify `from keras.layers.pooling import as _Pooling2D` for `from keras.layers.pooling import MaxPooling2D as _Pooling2D` )
